# 🚀 Full-Stack Intern Assignment

This project is a full-stack user authentication system developed as part of an internship assignment. It includes a **React + TypeScript** frontend built with Vite and a **Node.js + Prisma** backend using Express. The goal is to convert a provided Figma design into a functional application with proper validation, type safety, and error handling.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a full-stack application adhering to modern development practices using the following:

- Frontend: React (with TypeScript)
- Backend: Node.js (with Prisma ORM)
- Database: Neon DB (via Prisma)


## 🖼️ Frontend Overview

### 🔧 Stack & Tools

- React 19 + Vite
- TypeScript
- Zod – for data schema validation
- React Hook Form – for form handling
- React Query – for async data management

### 🏗️ Structure

- `components/` – Modular, reusable UI components matching the Figma design
- `hooks/` – Custom hooks to separate business logic
- `api/` – API handlers using React Query
- `schemas/` – Zod schemas for validation
- `types/` – Type definitions

### 🎨 Features

- Form validation with Zod + React Hook Form
- Type-safe API interactions
- Full error handling with meaningful messages
- Figma design fully implemented

---

## 🔐 Backend Overview

### 🔧 Stack & Tools

- Node.js + Express
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM
- Zod – for input validation
- Bcrypt – for password hashing

### 🗄️ User Schema (Prisma)

```prisma
model User {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String @unique
  password String
}
```

### 📁 Structure

- `routes/` – API endpoint definitions
- `controllers/` – Business logic for each route
- `middlewares/` – Error handling and validation
- `prisma/` – Prisma schema and migrations

### 🔐 Features

- Register and login endpoints
- Password hashing with Bcrypt
- Type-safe backend logic
- Middleware-based error handling

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # Create .env if not provided
npx prisma migrate dev   # Apply DB migrations
npm run dev              # Start backend server
```

---

### 2. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev              # Launch frontend on localhost
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the App

- Register a new user using the UI
- Attempt login with invalid credentials to test error handling
- Use browser devtools or console to verify React Query, Zod, and form behavior

---
